I've been bouncing around between picking a blog platform, and realized I should really settle down and stick with one. This is mostly a page to track my decision-making, and isn't meant to be an objective comparison of different platforms. The one thing I''ll be limiting myself to is static site generators. They're light, easy to write to, and I can keep my blog in source control.

## The markup language

I'd really rather avoid having to learn a wholle new markup, so that effectively limits me to either Markdown or ReST. While I really like the expressiveness of ReST, I don't think I'll be needing the advanced feautures enough to merit having to deal with the syntax.

## The tool's language

Meh, I really don't care. As long it takes less than 30 seconds to build the site, that's good enough for me.

## Templating

It would be nice if it had a minimal black on white theme available, but I'm not really averse to creating my own.

## Hosting

I'll be most likely hosting this on github pages. Integration with that would be a bonus, but I'm not going to specifically check for that.

## Candidates

A list of platforms that might meet my needs:

### [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/)

My previous platform. I thinks it's a great product, but it just didn't strike the right chord.

### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

By far and away the most popular static site generator. However, the YY/MM/DD/ folder structure it enforces irks me much more than it should.

### [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

The strongest contender so far. Simple and does what I need.
